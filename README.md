# CookieExFilter for FireFox

Adds a search bar to the Cookie Exceptions menu found in `Options > Privacy > Exceptions...` which lets you quickly find entries even if you don't know the full site name.

There are two different ways of searching;
 - Filter: List only the rules that match what is in search box
 - Scroll: Scroll down to the next rule that matches what is in the search box (using Enter/Return to go to next match)

You also have a choice of the way results are checked against search term;
 - Regular Expression
 - Glob
 - Mixture of these two (or neither for plain text)
